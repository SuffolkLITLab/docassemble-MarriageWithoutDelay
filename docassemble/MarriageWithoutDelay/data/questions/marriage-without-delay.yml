  **Next steps: **
    
  You will speak to a judge to find out if you and your partner can skip the 3 day waiting period. If you and your partner are allowed to skip the waiting period, you must file for a marriage license in person at your local city or town hall. Use the [Massachusetts City and Town Directory](https://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/eleclk/clkidx.htm) to find the town or city clerk's phone number.
  
  You will need to bring the following items to your local city or town hall with your approved Marriage Without Delay: 
  
  * Proof of your age, like a birth certificate or passport,
  
  * Your Social Security number - if you do not have an SSN, ask the town clerk what to do,
  
  * Payment for fees, if fees apply, and
  
  * The name you will use after your wedding if you decide to change your names.
  
   Other possible requirements:
  
  * The end date any prior marriages of the future spouses,
  
  * Names of your parents and where they were born,
  
  * Town you are getting married in.
  
  **Note**: Even though it says 'Probate and Family Court' at the top of this form, If you are filing in District Court you still use the same form.
