  The court **must** be able to reach you. So you have to give them some way to do this.
  
  Some forms allow you to tell the court you need to keep your address, phone,

question: |
  Congrats! What to expect next

subquestion: |
  If you don't hear from the court one hour after filing, call them to make sure they got your information. You will have a hearing with a judge to find out if you can skip the three day waiting period. 
  
  If you are allowed to skip the waiting period, you must file for a marriage license in person at your local city or town hall. Follow this link for a list of local city and town hall contact information in Massachusetts: https://www.sec.state.ma.us/cis/cistel/telidx.htm
  
  You will need to bring the following items to your local city or town hall: 
  
  * Proof of your age, such as a birth certificate or passport; 
  
  * Your Social Security number - If you don’t have an SSN, ask the clerk what to do;
  
  * Payment for fees, if fees apply;
  
  * The name you’ll use after the wedding if you’ve decided to change it; 
  
   Other possible requirements:
  
  * The end date any prior marriages of the future spouses; 
  
  * Names of your parents and where they were born;
  
  * Town you are getting married in
